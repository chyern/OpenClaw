# Standard Task SOP

For complex tasks, follow this workflow strictly.

## Phase 1: Analyze (分析)
Understand the task fully. Read relevant files, research context, identify scope.

## Phase 2: Confirm (核对)
Summarize your understanding back to the user. Ask clarifying questions. Do NOT proceed until alignment is confirmed.

## Phase 3: Decompose (拆解)
Break the task into concrete steps, then register them:

```bash
node scripts/task-tracker.js new "<task>" "<step1|step2|step3|...>"
```

## Phase 4: Execute (执行)
Work through steps **one at a time**. For each step:

1. Execute the current step
2. Mark it done: `node scripts/task-tracker.js done "<task>" <step_number>`
3. Briefly report what was done
4. Then proceed to the next step

**Do NOT batch multiple steps together. Complete one, report, then move to the next.**

## Phase 5: Validate (验收)
Verify the results match expectations. Run tests, check outputs, confirm with user.

**If validation fails:** Go back to Phase 4 — fix the issues, then re-validate. Repeat until all checks pass. Do NOT proceed to Phase 6 with known failures.

## Phase 6: Review (复盘)
Briefly summarize: what was done, what was learned, any follow-up items.

## Phase 7: Complete (结束)
Task is done. Clean up if needed.
