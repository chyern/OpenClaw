# Agent Workflow (Adaptive SOP)

## Proactive Internal Compass

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AI MUST follow this autonomous loop for every turn when a task is active:**
> 1. **Check Status & Mode**: Run `node scripts/workflow-status.js --auto`.
> 2. **Follow the GUIDE**: 
>    - If the output says `GUIDE: Mode is Auto-Pilot...`, then briefly inform the user and **IMMEDIATELY PROCEED**.
>    - If the output says `GUIDE: Mode is Manual Approval...`, then briefly inform the user and **WAIT for confirmation**.
> 3. **Sub-agent Routing (Efficiency)**: If `ADVICE: Large task detected...` appears, or if you identify multiple independent sub-tasks, use the **`spawn`** tool to delegate to a sub-agent.
> 4. **Execute NEXT_ACTION**: Strictly follow the `NEXT_ACTION` command provided by the script.

## Configuration (User Control)
- Users can switch modes using: `node scripts/set-mode.js <auto|manual>`
- Default mode is **Auto-Pilot**.

## Standard Initialization Logic
> 1. The task involves more than 3 logical steps.
> 2. The task falls under "Research, Deep Debugging, or Complex System Configuration".
> 3. The task involves large-scale modifications across multiple files.
> 
> **Standard Initialization Procedure:**
> - Immediately run `node scripts/state-machine.js init "<task_id>" "<task_name>"`.
> - Immediately run `node scripts/task-tracker.js new "<task_name>" "<step1|step2|...>"`.

## State Machine

```
IDLE → PLANNING → DELEGATING → EXECUTING → VERIFYING → MEMORYING → DONE
                            ↓
                     WAITING_SUBAGENT → EXECUTING
                            ↓
                       BLOCKED → EXECUTING (or DONE if cancelled)
```

### States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `IDLE` | No active task |
| `PLANNING` | Analyzing task, breaking into steps |
| `DELEGATING` | Running delegate decision |
| `EXECUTING` | Running steps, loop through |
| `VERIFYING` | Verifying results match expectations. Fail → retry EXECUTING |
| `WAITING_SUBAGENT` | Sub-agent running, waiting for result |
| `MEMORYING` | Writing learned patterns to memory |
| `BLOCKED` | Waiting for user confirmation |
| `DONE` | Task completed |
| `FAILED` | Task failed (can retry → PLANNING) |

## Scripts

### context-snapshot — preserve task context before compaction

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(npm root -g)/openclaw/skills/multi-step-workflow"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context-snapshot.js" save "<task>" "<findings>" "<pending>"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context-snapshot.js" load
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/context-snapshot.js" clear
```

Saves task-critical info to external file before OpenClaw auto-compacts context. Survives compaction.

### task-tracker — track steps

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(npm root -g)/openclaw/skills/multi-step-workflow"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/task-tracker.js" new "<task>" "<step1|step2|step3>"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/task-tracker.js" done "<task>" 1
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/task-tracker.js" list
```

### state-machine — workflow state manager

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(npm root -g)/openclaw/skills/multi-step-workflow"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/state-machine.js" init "<task_id>" "<task_name>"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/state-machine.js" get "<task_id>"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/state-machine.js" transition "<task_id>" "<from_state>" "<to_state>"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/state-machine.js" next "<task_id>"
```

Commands: init, get, transition, next, list, delete

### workflow-status — unified dashboard & intelligence

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(npm root -g)/openclaw/skills/multi-step-workflow"
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/workflow-status.js" [--auto]
```
- Use `--auto` for AI-optimized NEXT_ACTION recommendations.
